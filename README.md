# github-sync-upstream

This Python script automatically synchronizes a github user or an organization
forked repositories with their upstream parents.

**Warning:** this script is intended for synchronizing read-only repositories,
and will basically perform an automatic merge from upstream before
<ins>actually pushing the modifications</ins>. Use with caution.

## Setup

Create a virtualenv, install pip requirements from `requirements.txt`.

Set the following environment variables:

- `GITHUB_USERNAME`: your github username
- `GITHUB_PASSWORD`: your github password
- `GITHUB_ORGANIZATION`: a target github organization (optional)

## Usage

    $ ./github-sync-upstream

To have it running with no prompting for confirmation (convenient for cronjobs):

    $ ./github-sync-upstream --no_interactive

To directly pass env variables to the script (hazardous but convenient for cronjobs):

    $ GITHUB_USERNAME=foo GITHUB_PASSWORD=bar /path/to/github-sync-upstream --no_interactive

## Compatibility

This script requires Python 2.7+.
